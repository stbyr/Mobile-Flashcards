# Mobile Flashcards App

Mobile Flashcards is a mobile application for both Android and iOS that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The user can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and then take quizzes on those decks.

Data is stored in LocalStorage. The user receives daily notifications to remind them of using the app. A small animation is used when clicking a deck.

This app is the third and last assignment for the Udacity React Nanodegree.
